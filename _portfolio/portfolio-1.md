Research
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> The specific questions I aimed to address in my research include:<br>

1. how past tectonic events, such as continent-continent/continent-ocean convergence, orogenic collapse, continental rifting, and magmatism, modified the structures of lithosphere <br>
2. What the major composition of lower continental crust is, and how they varied over geological time<br> 
3. To what degree geological observations at surface correlates with seismological-defined lithospheric structures at depth.</div> <br>
