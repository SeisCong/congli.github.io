<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a seismologist with a deep interest in understanding the Earth's lithospheric dynamics by imaging its structures using various seismological methods. Throughout my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, I have focused on the evolution of the continental lithosphere in eastern North America and the Tibet Plateau, and subduction zone dynamics in South America.</div> 

## Research Interests
 * Observational and computational seismology
 * Evolution of continental lithosphere
 * Subduction zone dynamics
 * Near-surface structures and seismicity

## Seismology Methodology
  * Teleseismic Receiver Function Analysis
  * Multi-mode dispersion curve inversion
  * Full-waveform inversion
