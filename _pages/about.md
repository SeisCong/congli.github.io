<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a seismologist deeply interested in understanding evolution of orogenic belts and subduction dynamics through the investigation of their subsurface structures using various seismological imaging methods. My Ph.D. and postdoctoral research have primarily focused on the paleo-orogenic belt in eastern North America and the modern orogenic belt in the SE Tibet Plateau and the in northern Andes. Additionally, I have concentrated on studying subduction zone dynamics in Cascadia and South America.</div> 

## Research Interests
 * Observational and computational seismology
 * Evolution of orogenic belts
 * Subduction zone dynamics
 * Near-surface structures and seismicity

## Seismology Methodology
  * Teleseismic Receiver Function Analysis
  * Ambient noise and surface-wave tomography
  * Full-waveform inversion
