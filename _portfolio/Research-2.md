title: "Crustal thickness variation beneath eastern North America"
excerpt: "* A 12-15 km Moho step is found across the geologically-defined Gander-Grenville boundary in southern New England, revealed from teleseismic P-wave receiver function analysis <br/> <br/> <img src='https://conli87.github.io/congli.github.io/images/Fig2.png'>" <br/>
          * A larger picture shows that the Moho step distributed along the central Appalachian, and the variation becomes gradual its northern and southern ends  <br/> <br/> <img src='https://conli87.github.io/congli.github.io/images/Fig3.png'>

Research
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> The specific questions I aimed to address in my research include:<br>

1. how past tectonic events, such as continent-continent/continent-ocean convergence, orogenic collapse, continental rifting, and magmatism, modified the structures of lithosphere <br>
2. What the major composition of lower continental crust is, and how they varied over geological time<br> 
3. To what degree geological observations at surface correlates with seismological-defined lithospheric structures at depth.</div> <br>
